title: Detailed Documentation for the `Stepper` and `StepperItem` Components
description: This section will break down the `Stepper` and `StepperItem` components, explaining the key imports, structure, and functionality. The `Stepper` component is designed to create a vertically aligned list with numbered steps, while the `StepperItem` component acts as a wrapper for each individual step.
---

### 1. **Imports**

```js
import { cn } from "@/lib/utils";
import clsx from "clsx";
import { Children, PropsWithChildren } from "react";
```

- **`cn`**: A utility function imported from `@/lib/utils`, which helps merge and conditionally apply CSS classes.
- **`clsx`**: A utility for conditionally constructing className strings. It's similar to `cn` but provides more granular control over class merging.
- **`Children`**: A React utility that provides helper functions to interact with the component's children, such as `count` and `map`.
- **`PropsWithChildren`**: A TypeScript utility that extends a component’s props to include `children`, allowing the component to wrap its content around other child elements.

---

### 2. **`Stepper` Component**

The `Stepper` component wraps a list of steps, automatically numbering each one. It leverages `Children` from React to iterate over the steps and adds styles and layout structure.

```js
export function Stepper({ children }: PropsWithChildren) {
  const length = Children.count(children);
```

- **PropsWithChildren**: Extends the component's props to include any child elements.
- **`length`**: Uses `Children.count(children)` to get the total number of steps (children) passed to the `Stepper` component.

---

#### Step Mapping and Styling

```js
return (
  <div className="flex flex-col">
    {Children.map(children, (child, index) => {
      return (
        <div
          className={cn(
            "border-l pl-9 relative",
            clsx({
              "pb-5 ": index < length - 1,
            })
          )}
        >
          <div className="bg-secondary w-8 h-8 text-xs font-medium rounded-full flex items-center justify-center absolute -left-4 font-code">
            {index + 1}
          </div>
          {child}
        </div>
      );
    })}
  </div>
);
```

- **`flex flex-col`**: This CSS class applied to the container ensures that the steps are laid out in a vertical column.
- **`Children.map`**: This method iterates over each child (step) in the `Stepper`, applying unique styling and numbering.
  
#### Inside the `map` function:

- **`border-l pl-9 relative`**: These classes apply a left border and padding, creating the visual line that connects each step. `relative` is used for positioning the number indicator (`index + 1`).
- **`clsx`**: Adds the `pb-5` (padding-bottom) class conditionally, but only if the current step (`index`) is not the last one. This ensures that all but the last step have spacing underneath.
- **`bg-secondary w-8 h-8`**: The circle surrounding the step number is given a secondary background color and sized to be 8x8.
- **`text-xs font-medium`**: Styles for the text inside the circle, ensuring the step number is centered and legible.
- **`absolute -left-4`**: Positions the step number to the left of the content, aligning with the vertical line (`border-l`).

### Example Usage

To see the `Stepper` in action, wrap your steps like so:

```jsx
<Stepper>
  <StepperItem title="Step 1">Content for Step 1</StepperItem>
  <StepperItem title="Step 2">Content for Step 2</StepperItem>
  <StepperItem title="Step 3">Content for Step 3</StepperItem>
</Stepper>
```

This renders a vertical sequence of numbered steps, with each step wrapped in the `StepperItem` component.

---

### 3. **`StepperItem` Component**

The `StepperItem` acts as a wrapper for individual steps. It receives the step content and an optional title, and applies specific styles to each one.

```js
export function StepperItem({
  children,
  title,
}: PropsWithChildren & { title?: string }) {
  return (
    <div className="pt-0.5">
      <h4 className="mt-0">{title}</h4>
      <div>{children}</div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

- **PropsWithChildren & { title?: string }**: This defines that the component accepts children (the content of the step) and an optional `title` prop.
  
#### Inside the `StepperItem` Component:

- **`pt-0.5`**: Adds a small amount of padding to the top of the step to create space between the title and the previous step.
- **`h4 className="mt-0"`**: The title of the step is rendered in an `h4` element with no top margin (`mt-0`), keeping the spacing consistent.
- **`{children}`**: The content passed as children (e.g., text, images, or additional components) is rendered beneath the title.

---

### Example Usage for `StepperItem`

A basic example of the `StepperItem` might look like this:

```jsx
<StepperItem title="Install Dependencies">
  Run `npm install` to install the necessary packages.
</StepperItem>
```

This will render the step with a title "Install Dependencies" and a description saying "Run `npm install` to install the necessary packages."

---

### Final Combined Example

Using both the `Stepper` and `StepperItem` together:

```jsx
<Stepper>
  <StepperItem title="Step 1: Initialize Project">
    Start by running `npm init` to initialize your project.
  </StepperItem>
  <StepperItem title="Step 2: Install Dependencies">
    Run `npm install` to install the necessary packages.
  </StepperItem>
  <StepperItem title="Step 3: Start Development">
    Use `npm start` to begin the development server.
  </StepperItem>
</Stepper>
```

This code will render a vertical stepper with 3 steps, where each step is clearly numbered and titled, and contains a brief description of the step’s content.

### Explanation of Key Concepts

- **Conditional Styling with `clsx` and `cn`**: The combination of `clsx` and `cn` helps manage complex class names. This allows for dynamic styling based on the index and length of the steps, ensuring consistent layout and spacing.
- **React `Children` API**: The use of `Children.count` and `Children.map` ensures that all child components inside the `Stepper` are correctly handled. This is a powerful method to dynamically generate step content based on the number of children passed into the component.
- **Modular and Reusable Components**: By separating the `Stepper` and `StepperItem` components, the code becomes more modular and reusable. You can easily add or remove steps without altering the core functionality of the `Stepper`.

This approach is highly flexible, allowing developers to customize the stepper for various use cases, from onboarding flows to installation guides.
