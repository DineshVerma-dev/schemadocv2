title: Custom Breadcrumb Component
description: This code defines a set of reusable breadcrumb components using React and the Radix UI library. Breadcrumbs are navigational aids that show the path or hierarchy of the current page within an application, providing context and quick navigation.
---

Let's break down the code and understand its structure:

#### 1. **Imports**:
- **React**: Core library for defining components and managing state.
- **Slot from Radix UI**: Allows rendering a different element/component dynamically (useful for `asChild` behavior).
- **ChevronRight, MoreHorizontal from lucide-react**: Icons used to represent separators between breadcrumb items and an ellipsis for truncated paths.
- **`cn` from utils**: This utility function helps apply conditional and dynamic CSS class names (likely from a helper file).

#### 2. **Breadcrumb** Component:
```ts
const Breadcrumb = React.forwardRef(...)
```
- This is the root component that defines the breadcrumb navigation container.
- It extends a `<nav>` element and uses the `aria-label="breadcrumb"` attribute to provide screen readers with the context that this is a breadcrumb navigation.
- `React.forwardRef` is used to pass a `ref` down to the DOM node, which is useful for DOM access or manipulation.
- The component accepts a `separator` prop (though unused here) to allow custom separator elements.

#### 3. **BreadcrumbList** Component:
```ts
const BreadcrumbList = React.forwardRef(...)
```
- This component defines the ordered list (`<ol>`) that wraps around the individual breadcrumb items.
- It applies utility classes such as `"flex"`, `"gap"`, and `"text-sm"` to style the list items in a horizontal, responsive layout.
- You can pass additional class names via `className` to customize its appearance.

#### 4. **BreadcrumbItem** Component:
```ts
const BreadcrumbItem = React.forwardRef(...)
```
- Each breadcrumb is wrapped in a `<li>` element (list item) to represent a single part of the breadcrumb path.
- It applies some flexbox utilities and accepts `className` for additional styles.
- This component serves as a container for links, pages, or other breadcrumb-related elements.

#### 5. **BreadcrumbLink** Component:
```ts
const BreadcrumbLink = React.forwardRef(...)
```
- This component is used for clickable breadcrumb links. It extends an anchor (`<a>`) element by default.
- It includes an `asChild` prop that allows rendering the link as a different component by using Radix UI’s `Slot`. For example, if `asChild` is true, you can render a `<button>` instead of an anchor tag.
- It applies the class `"transition-colors hover:text-foreground"` for styling, ensuring the link changes color on hover.

#### 6. **BreadcrumbPage** Component:
```ts
const BreadcrumbPage = React.forwardRef(...)
```
- This component represents the current page in the breadcrumb trail. It’s not a clickable link but simply indicates the active page.
- The `role="link"` and `aria-current="page"` attributes help screen readers recognize that this is the current page, and `aria-disabled="true"` prevents interaction.
- It applies a `font-normal text-foreground` class to style the current page.

#### 7. **BreadcrumbSeparator** Component:
```ts
const BreadcrumbSeparator = ({ ...props }) => (...)
```
- The separator between breadcrumb items. By default, it renders a right-facing arrow (`<ChevronRight />`).
- The `role="presentation"` and `aria-hidden="true"` attributes are added to ensure that the separator is ignored by assistive technologies like screen readers.
- You can customize the separator by passing children, e.g., a different icon or text.

#### 8. **BreadcrumbEllipsis** Component:
```ts
const BreadcrumbEllipsis = ({ ...props }) => (...)
```
- This component renders an ellipsis (`<MoreHorizontal />` icon) used for truncating long breadcrumb paths when not all items are shown.
- It uses the class `"sr-only"` to add visually hidden content for screen readers (e.g., "More") while keeping the ellipsis icon visible to users.

#### 9. **Exports**:
```ts
export {
  Breadcrumb,
  BreadcrumbList,
  BreadcrumbItem,
  BreadcrumbLink,
  BreadcrumbPage,
  BreadcrumbSeparator,
  BreadcrumbEllipsis,
}
```
- All breadcrumb components (`Breadcrumb`, `BreadcrumbList`, `BreadcrumbItem`, etc.) are exported for use in other parts of the application. These components can be composed to build a breadcrumb navigation.

### How to Upgrade or Customize

There are several ways to modify or extend the functionality of these breadcrumb components:

#### 1. **Styling**:
- Adjust the default classes for spacing, color, font size, etc., to match the design of your application.
  - For example, you can change the `text-sm` class in `BreadcrumbList` to modify the text size.
  - You can replace the `ChevronRight` in `BreadcrumbSeparator` with custom icons, text, or styles.

#### 2. **Interactive Breadcrumbs**:
- **`BreadcrumbLink`**: You can pass custom logic or hooks (e.g., `onClick` handlers) to the `BreadcrumbLink` component to execute additional actions when breadcrumbs are clicked.
  - You can also use the `asChild` prop to render a `button` or another element instead of an anchor (`<a>`).

#### 3. **Dynamic Content**:
- The breadcrumbs could be dynamically generated based on your application’s routing structure. For example, if you're using a framework like Next.js or React Router, you can programmatically build the breadcrumb trail based on the current URL or navigation state.

#### 4. **Breadcrumb with Icons**:
- You can extend `BreadcrumbItem` to render icons next to the links or the current page:
  ```ts
  <BreadcrumbItem>
    <HomeIcon className="h-4 w-4 mr-2" />
    <BreadcrumbLink href="/home">Home</BreadcrumbLink>
  </BreadcrumbItem>
  ```

#### 5. **Breadcrumb Truncation**:
- The `BreadcrumbEllipsis` component provides a visual cue when breadcrumbs are truncated. You could further enhance this by making the ellipsis clickable, triggering a dropdown to show the hidden breadcrumb items.
  - Example:
    ```ts
    <BreadcrumbEllipsis onClick={handleDropdownOpen} />
    ```

#### 6. **Accessibility**:
- These components already provide basic accessibility features like `aria-label`, `aria-current`, and `aria-hidden`. If you want to improve accessibility, you can further test the breadcrumbs using screen readers and enhance them based on the user’s needs.
  
#### 7. **Custom Separator**:
- You can pass a custom separator element instead of the default `ChevronRight` by using the `separator` prop in the `Breadcrumb` component. For instance, you could use a custom icon or text:
  ```ts
  <BreadcrumbSeparator>
    <span>/</span>
  </BreadcrumbSeparator>
  ```

#### 8. **Responsive Breadcrumbs**:
- Modify the layout of breadcrumbs to adapt to different screen sizes. You could use Tailwind’s responsive utilities to change the breadcrumb layout or size based on breakpoints.
  - For example, you could adjust the gap between breadcrumb items for smaller screens:
    ```ts
    <BreadcrumbList className="sm:gap-2 md:gap-4" />
    ```

This breadcrumb component structure is flexible and customizable, allowing you to adapt it to your application's needs by adjusting styles, behavior, and content dynamically.
