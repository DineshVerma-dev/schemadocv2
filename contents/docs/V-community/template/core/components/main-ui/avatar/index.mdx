title: Custom Avatar Component
description: This code defines a reusable `Avatar` component and its related sub-components using React and Radix UI's Avatar primitive. It allows rendering avatars (user profile pictures), including an image fallback for cases when the image is unavailable.
---

Let's break down the code and understand its structure:

#### 1. `"use client"` directive:
- As before, this directive is used in a Next.js environment to indicate that this code should only run on the client side.

#### 2. **Imports**:
- **React**: Used to define components and handle rendering.
- **AvatarPrimitive from Radix UI**: Provides accessible avatar components that are extended and customized.
- **`cn` from utils**: This utility function simplifies applying conditional and dynamic CSS classes. It likely comes from a helper file in the project.

#### 3. **Avatar** Component:
```ts
const Avatar = React.forwardRef(...)
```
- This is the root component of the avatar structure. It serves as the outer container for the avatar image and fallback content.
- `React.forwardRef` is used to pass down the `ref` to the DOM element for direct access if necessary.
- It applies the class `"relative flex h-10 w-10 shrink-0 overflow-hidden rounded-full"`, which makes the avatar a square with rounded corners (i.e., a circle) and ensures it's flexible (`shrink-0` prevents it from shrinking).
- `className` allows further custom classes to be passed as props for styling.
- `cn` combines the default and custom class names.

#### 4. **AvatarImage** Component:
```ts
const AvatarImage = React.forwardRef(...)
```
- This component renders the actual image inside the avatar.
- It uses the `AvatarPrimitive.Image` component from Radix, which ensures that the image loading and accessibility are handled correctly.
- It applies the class `"aspect-square h-full w-full"` to make sure the image fills the entire container and maintains a square aspect ratio (helpful for avatars).
- If additional classes are passed via `className`, they are added dynamically using `cn`.

#### 5. **AvatarFallback** Component:
```ts
const AvatarFallback = React.forwardRef(...)
```
- This component renders fallback content if the avatar image is unavailable (e.g., due to a failed image load or missing image URL).
- It uses `AvatarPrimitive.Fallback` from Radix to handle fallback logic. It defaults to showing some content, like initials or an icon, inside the avatar.
- The class `"flex h-full w-full items-center justify-center rounded-full bg-muted"` ensures the fallback content is centered, covers the whole avatar, and is displayed as a circle.
  - `bg-muted` likely refers to a muted background color defined elsewhere in your CSS (e.g., Tailwind CSS or a custom utility).
- As with other components, `cn` is used to combine any extra classes passed as `className`.

#### 6. **Exports**:
```ts
export { Avatar, AvatarImage, AvatarFallback }
```
- The `Avatar`, `AvatarImage`, and `AvatarFallback` components are exported to be used in other parts of the application. These components can be combined to create a complete avatar experience.

### How to Upgrade or Customize

You can easily modify or extend the functionality of these components to suit specific design needs or to add new features.

#### 1. **Styling**:
- Adjust the default classes applied to the `Avatar`, `AvatarImage`, and `AvatarFallback` to change how they look.
  - For example, you can change the size of the avatar by updating `h-10 w-10` in `Avatar`.
  - You could apply custom border styles or shadow effects around the avatar.
- To change the background color of the fallback, update the `bg-muted` class or pass a custom background class through `className`.

#### 2. **Fallback Content**:
- Currently, the `AvatarFallback` simply displays centered fallback content. You can customize this to show initials, icons, or any other custom content by passing it as children.
- Example:
  ```ts
  <AvatarFallback>AB</AvatarFallback>
  ```
  This would display the initials "AB" when the avatar image fails to load.

#### 3. **Responsive Design**:
- You could modify the avatar to respond to different screen sizes. For instance, applying different sizes based on breakpoints (e.g., `sm:h-8 sm:w-8 md:h-12 md:w-12`) would adjust the avatarâ€™s dimensions on various screen sizes.

#### 4. **Custom Animations**:
- Add custom animations to the avatar when it appears, like fading in the image or bouncing the fallback if the image fails to load. This can be done by adding `transition` or `animation` properties to the `AvatarImage` or `AvatarFallback`.

#### 5. **State and Error Handling**:
- Although Radix UI handles fallback logic, you could further enhance this by adding a custom state to handle loading errors.
- For example, using a `useState` hook to manage whether the image failed to load and dynamically rendering the fallback or the image:
  ```ts
  const [imageError, setImageError] = React.useState(false);

  return (
    <Avatar>
      {!imageError ? (
        <AvatarImage src="/path/to/image.jpg" onError={() => setImageError(true)} />
      ) : (
        <AvatarFallback>AB</AvatarFallback>
      )}
    </Avatar>
  );
  ```

#### 6. **Icon Support**:
- If you want to show an icon instead of text in the fallback, you can import and use an icon component, like `lucide-react` or `react-icons`, inside `AvatarFallback`:
  ```ts
  <AvatarFallback>
    <UserIcon className="h-4 w-4" />
  </AvatarFallback>
  ```

#### 7. **Dynamic Content**:
- You can pass dynamic URLs or content to the `AvatarImage` and `AvatarFallback` components. For example, if you are building a user profile page, you might fetch the user's avatar URL from a server and pass it to the `src` prop of `AvatarImage`.

This avatar component is highly customizable, allowing for many design and functionality modifications, from simple style changes to complex error handling.
