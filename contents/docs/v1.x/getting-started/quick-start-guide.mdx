## Project Structure

Your Schema Doc project will have the following structure:

```plaintext
schemadoc
├── app
├── components
├── content
│   ├── docs
│   │   └── [Your Documentation Files].mdx
│   └── blog
│       └── [Your Blog Posts].mdx
├── lib
│   ├── site-config.js
│   └── routes-config.ts
└── package.json
```

## Customizing Your Site

### 1. Editing Content

- **Docs**: Modify or add new documentation files in the `content/docs` folder. You can create subfolders to organize your content further.
- **Blog**: Add or update blog posts in the `content/blog` folder.

### 2. Configuring Routes

Edit the `lib/routes-config.ts` file to customize the pages and their names. This file controls how different sections of your site are routed.

### 3. Updating Site Configuration

In the `site-config.js` file located in the `lib` folder, you can update the following configuration to match your site’s details:

```jsx
export const DATA = {
  siteName: "LISA/Schema",
  siteDescription: "A documentation on Schema Doc app",
  siteUrl: "https://schemadoc.vercel.app/",
  githubUrl: "https://github.com/lisaorg",
  terminalCommand: "npm install lisa@latest",
  authorName: "amyssnippet",
  authorUrl: "https://github.com/amyssnippet",
  // You can specify any other URLs like your personal portfolio or social media profiles
};
```

Simply replace the placeholder values with your own site’s information. This setup allows you to quickly adapt Schema Doc to fit your needs without modifying the core UI components.
