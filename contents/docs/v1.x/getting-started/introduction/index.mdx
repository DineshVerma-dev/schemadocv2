<Note title="Remember" type="danger">
  This documentation covers how to use Schemadoc version 1.x, with a focus on specific stable versions like v1.1.9. Some earlier minor and patch versions, such as v1.1.6 and v1.1.7, were released without proper code checks, debugging, and testing, causing issues. We recommend using the latest version for improved features, but if you prefer v1.x, it's best to use v1.1.9.

## What is Schema doc?

**Schema Doc**, a streamlined documentation template designed to make the process of creating and managing documentation effortless and efficient. Built with the power of Next.js and MDX, Schema Doc offers a fully customizable framework that allows you to focus entirely on content creation, without the hassle of building UI components from scratch.

## Why Schema doc?

Schema Doc is inspired by popular tools like Docusaurus but takes it a step further by providing a pre-built environment where everything from layouts to components is already configured and ready to use. This means you don't have to spend time setting up your documentation siteâ€”simply start writing your content.

## Key features 

- **Pre-Built Components**: All UI components are pre-made, so you can immediately begin focusing on your documentation content.
- **Content-First Approach**: With Schema Doc, all you need to worry about is your content. The heavy lifting of site structure, design, and deployment is handled for you.
- **Configurable Settings**: Customizable site settings such as SiteName, description, and other important data are stored in a separate configuration file. This enables you to set up your entire website without needing to dive into the app or components directory.
- **Powered by Next.js & MDX**: Schema Doc harnesses the power and flexibility of Next.js and MDX, allowing you to create rich, interactive documentation with minimal effort.

## Who Should Use Schema Doc?

Whether you're a developer, technical writer, or anyone in need of a robust documentation site, Schema Doc is for you. It provides a perfect balance between simplicity and power, making it the ideal choice for both beginners and advanced users alike.
