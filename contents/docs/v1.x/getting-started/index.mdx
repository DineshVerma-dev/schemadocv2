## What is Schema doc?

**Schema Doc**, a streamlined documentation template designed to make the process of creating and managing documentation effortless and efficient. Built with the power of Next.js and MDX, Schema Doc offers a fully customizable framework that allows you to focus entirely on content creation, without the hassle of building UI components from scratch.

## Why Schema doc?

Schema Doc is inspired by popular tools like Docusaurus but takes it a step further by providing a pre-built environment where everything from layouts to components is already configured and ready to use. This means you don't have to spend time setting up your documentation siteâ€”simply start writing your content.

## Key features 

- **Pre-Built Components**: All UI components are pre-made, so you can immediately begin focusing on your documentation content.
- **Content-First Approach**: With Schema Doc, all you need to worry about is your content. The heavy lifting of site structure, design, and deployment is handled for you.
- **Configurable Settings**: Customizable site settings such as SiteName, description, and other important data are stored in a separate configuration file. This enables you to set up your entire website without needing to dive into the app or components directory.
- **Powered by Next.js & MDX**: Schema Doc harnesses the power and flexibility of Next.js and MDX, allowing you to create rich, interactive documentation with minimal effort.

## Who Should Use Schema Doc?

Whether you're a developer, technical writer, or anyone in need of a robust documentation site, Schema Doc is for you. It provides a perfect balance between simplicity and power, making it the ideal choice for both beginners and advanced users alike.
