description: Configuring Routes using const-ROUTES.
---

The `ROUTES` constant in `lib/routes-config.ts` defines the structure of your site's navigation and routing. It determines how different sections and pages are organized and accessed. Here’s how to configure and customize the ROUTES constant:

## Basic Structure

The `ROUTES` constant is an array of route objects. Each object represents a section in your documentation and can contain nested items. Here’s an example:

```jsx
export const ROUTES: EachRoute[] = [
  {
    title: "Getting Started",
    href: "/getting-started",
    noLink: true,
    items: [
      { title: "Introduction", href: "/introduction" },
      {
        title: "Installation",
        href: "/installation",
        items: [
          { title: "Laravel", href: "/laravel" },
          { title: "React", href: "/react" },
          { title: "Gatsby", href: "/gatsby" },
        ],
      },
      { title: "Quick Start Guide", href: "/quick-start-guide" },
      {
        title: "Project Structure",
        href: "/project-structure",
        items: [
          { title: "Layouts", href: "/layouts" },
          { title: "Integrations", href: "/integrations" },
          {
            title: "Manual",
            href: "/manual",
            items: [
              { title: "JavaScript", href: "/javascript" },
              { title: "Typescript", href: "/typescript" },
              { title: "Golang", href: "/golang" },
            ],
          },
        ],
      },
      { title: "Changelog", href: "/changelog" },
      {
        title: "FAQ",
        href: "/faq",
      },
    ],
  },
  {
    title: "Server Actions",
    href: "/server-actions",
    noLink: true,
    items: [
      { title: "getSession", href: "/getSession" },
      { title: "getToken", href: "/getToken" },
      { title: "getRole", href: "/getRole" },
    ],
  },
  {
    title: "React Hooks",
    href: "/react-hooks",
    noLink: true,
    items: [
      { title: "useSession", href: "/use-session" },
      { title: "useFetch", href: "/use-fetch" },
      { title: "useAuth", href: "/use-auth" },
      { title: "useProduct", href: "/use-product" },
      { title: "useOrder", href: "/use-order" },
      { title: "useCart", href: "/use-cart" },
      { title: "usePayment", href: "/use-payment" },
      { title: "useShipping", href: "/use-shipping" },
      { title: "useNotification", href: "/use-notification" },
      { title: "useReview", href: "/use-review" },
      { title: "useInventory", href: "/use-inventory" },
      { title: "useUser", href: "/use-user" },
      { title: "useSettings", href: "/use-settings" },
      { title: "useAnalytics", href: "/use-analytics" },
      { title: "useTheme", href: "/use-theme" },
      { title: "useRouter", href: "/use-router" },
      { title: "useData", href: "/use-data" },
    ],
  },
];
```

## Route Configuration

1. **Top-Level Sections**: Each object in the `ROUTES` array represents a top-level section in your documentation. For example, the "Getting Started" and "Site Data" sections are top-level entries.
   - **title**: The display name of the section.
   - **href**: The URL path for the section. If noLink is true, this section will not have a direct link, serving as a heading for nested items.
   - **noLink**: When set to true, the section is used as a heading and does not have a direct link.
  
 2. **Nested Items**: Each section can contain an items array, which lists the individual pages or subsections. Each item has:
   - **title**: The title of the page or subsection.
   - **href**: The URL path for the page.

## Customizing the Routes

1. **Add New Sections**: To add a new top-level section, insert a new object into the `ROUTES` array. Define its title, href, and items as needed.

```jsx
{
  title: "New Section",
  href: "/new-section",
  noLink: true,
  items: [
    { title: "Subpage 1", href: "/subpage-1" },
    { title: "Subpage 2", href: "/subpage-2" },
  ],
},
```

2. **Update Existing Sections**: Modify the `title` and `href` properties of existing sections and items to reflect the current structure and naming of your documentation.
3. **Remove Sections**: To remove a section or page, simply delete the corresponding object or item from the `ROUTES` array.

## Example Configuration

Here’s an example of how the `ROUTES` constant might look with customized sections:

```jsx
export const ROUTES: EachRoute[] = [
  {
    title: "Introduction",
    href: "/introduction",
    noLink: false,
  },
  {
    title: "Documentation",
    href: "/docs",
    noLink: true,
    items: [
      { title: "Getting Started", href: "/docs/getting-started" },
      { title: "API Reference", href: "/docs/api-reference" },
    ],
  },
  {
    title: "Support",
    href: "/support",
    noLink: true,
    items: [
      { title: "FAQ", href: "/support/faq" },
      { title: "Contact Us", href: "/support/contact" },
    ],
  },
];
```

This configuration allows you to organize your documentation into clear, navigable sections and pages, ensuring users can easily find and access the information they need.
