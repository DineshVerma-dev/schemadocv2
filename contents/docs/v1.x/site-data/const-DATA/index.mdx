The `DATA` constant in `lib/site-config.js` is used to define various site-wide settings and information for your Schema Doc project. This configuration helps in customizing key details about your documentation site without altering the core components. Here’s a breakdown of how to use and customize the `DATA` constant:

## Basic Structure 

The `DATA` constant is an object that contains several properties, each representing a piece of site-specific information:

```jsx
export const DATA = {
  siteName: "Schema",
  siteDescription: "A documentation template built by amyssnippet under the name of LISA org.",
  siteUrl: "https://schema-document-template.vercel.app/",
  githubUrl: "https://github.com/lisaorg",
  xUrl: "https://x.com/",
  terminalCommand: "npm install lisa@latest",
  authorName: "amyssnippet",
  authorUrl: "https://github.com/amyssnippet",
  // you can specify any other URLs like your personal portfolio or social media profiles
};
```

## Customising the `DATA`

1. siteName: Set this to the name of your site. It will typically be used in the site’s header or title tag.

```jsx
siteName: "My Documentation Site",
```

2. siteDescription: Provide a brief description of your site. This will be used in meta tags for SEO and possibly in the site’s footer.

```jsx
siteDescription: "A comprehensive documentation site for My Project.",
```

3. siteUrl: Specify the URL where your documentation site will be hosted. This is used for absolute links and SEO.

```jsx
siteUrl: "https://my-documentation-site.com/",
```

4. githubUrl: Enter the URL to your project’s GitHub repository. This is often linked from the site’s footer or other relevant sections.

```jsx
githubUrl: "https://github.com/myusername/myproject",
```

5. xUrl: Include any additional URLs that you want to link to from your site, such as social media profiles.

```jsx
xUrl: "https://twitter.com/myusername",
```

6. terminalCommand: Provide a terminal command that users can run to install or set up your project. This is useful for quickly getting started.

```jsx
terminalCommand: "npm install myproject@latest",
```

7. authorName: Name of the author or organization behind the documentation.

```jsx
authorName: "MyUsername",
```

8. authorUrl: Link to the author’s or organization’s profile, portfolio, or social media.

```jsx
authorUrl: "https://github.com/myusername",
```

You can also specify other URLs like personal portfolios or additional social media links by adding more fields to the `DATA` object.

## Example Configuration

Here’s an example of a customized `DATA` object:

```jsx
export const DATA = {
  siteName: "MyProject Docs",
  siteDescription: "Documentation for MyProject, providing detailed guides and examples.",
  siteUrl: "https://docs.myproject.com/",
  githubUrl: "https://github.com/myusername/myproject",
  xUrl: "https://twitter.com/myusername",
  terminalCommand: "npm install myproject@latest",
  authorName: "MyName",
  authorUrl: "https://github.com/myusername",
};
```

This configuration will tailor the documentation site’s branding and links to match your specific project and preferences.
