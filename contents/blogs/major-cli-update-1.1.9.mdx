Hot on the heels of yesterday‚Äôs official launch of Schema Doc, we‚Äôre excited to announce a major upgrade to the template! Version 1.1.0 is here, and it‚Äôs packed with new features designed to make your experience even better.

## What‚Äôs New in Schema Doc?

1. **Command-Line Interface (CLI) Commands**: We‚Äôve introduced powerful CLI commands to simplify your setup process. Now, you can easily configure your Schema Doc instance by answering a few prompts. The CLI guides you through setting up your site‚Äôs key information, making initial configuration straightforward and hassle-free.

2. **Editable Configurations**: Flexibility is at the heart of Schema Doc‚Äôs latest upgrade. Users can now edit their configurations directly in schema.config.ts located in the root directory of the app. This means you have full control over your site‚Äôs settings and can make adjustments on the fly without diving into code.

### Why This Upgrade Matters

Our goal with these enhancements is to provide an even smoother experience for users. The CLI commands streamline the setup process, while the editable configurations offer more control and customization options. Whether you‚Äôre a seasoned developer or just starting, these updates make managing your documentation and blog easier than ever.

## Get Started with the Latest Features

To take advantage of these new features, simply update your Schema Doc installation to the latest version. Check out our updated documentation [here](https://schemadoc.vercel.app/) for detailed instructions on using the new CLI commands and editing your configurations.

We‚Äôre committed to continuously improving Schema Doc and appreciate your feedback. Keep an eye on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/lisaorg/schemadoc) for future updates and enhancements.

Thank you for being a part of the Schema Doc journey. Here‚Äôs to creating amazing documentation and blogs with ease!

Happy Coding!
